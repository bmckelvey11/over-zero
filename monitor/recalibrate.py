"""Grade a walk-forward recalibration of the probit against the v1 probit.

  python monitor/recalibrate.py [--season ...] [--min-train 3] [--self-check]

WHY: 0.25-Kelly sizes off the probit's P(over), and that probability is
miscalibrated in ALTERNATING directions across bias bins (+3.1pp at 1.00-1.75,
-3.7pp at 1.75-2.50). No monotone rescale of a linear index -- refitting
const/slope, Platt scaling -- can move two bins in opposite directions, so the
fix has to change SHAPE. This fits a binned empirical calibrator on training
seasons only and grades whether it actually sizes better out of sample.

PRE-COMMITTED metrics (fixed before any result was looked at), on the
bias > 1.0 candidate set:

  A (headline)  total profit in bankroll units, flat bankroll, 0.25-Kelly.
                Rewards better sizing AND legitimately declining to bet.
  B             ROI per unit staked, reported with N staked and total stake --
                uninterpretable alone, since not betting inflates it.
  C (decomp)    Metric A recomputed with the STAKED SET FROZEN to whatever the
                baseline staked. Isolates resizing from selection: gain that
                survives C is real recalibration; gain that only appears in A
                is "stop betting bias 1.00-1.75", which is a playbook change,
                not a model change.

Verdict rule, also pre-committed: implement only if the season-block bootstrap
95% CI on the paired per-season profit difference (A) excludes 0 AND the
frozen-set decomposition (C) shows the gain is not purely selection.
