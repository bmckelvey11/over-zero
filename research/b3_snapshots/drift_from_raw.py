"""B3: open-to-close totals drift, computed directly from raw historical
lines files (../cfb-site/data/raw/lines_{season}.json) instead of a live
capture_odds.py snapshot loop.

Owner-approved deviation from the original plan; see research/BLOCKERS.md,
"2026-07-31 -- B3.1 (odds snapshot capture) -- plan deviation, owner-approved".

Two populations, per game-book pair with both overUnderOpen and overUnder
present:
  ALL games        -- every qualifying book-game pair.
  QUALIFYING games  -- restricted to games whose closing consensus line
                       (via pick_line) has censoring bias > 1.0 (i.e. the
                       spread/total combination pushes one team's implied
                       score toward the zero floor).

drift = overUnder - overUnderOpen (positive = total rose toward close).
