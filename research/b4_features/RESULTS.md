## Checklist

### (1) Any feature *SIG* (p < 0.0125)?
**Yes.** `neutralSite` is significant under Bonferroni (p=0.006706 < 0.0125). The effect is negative: games at neutral sites show reduced over-win probability relative to the censoring baseline (standardized coefficient −0.0220, SE 0.0081). This is inconsistent with the hypothesis that neutral sites favor overs; instead, the data suggests neutral sites are associated with *lower* over rates after controlling for censoring bias.

### (2) biasTotals shift over 1 SE?
**No.** The `biasTotals` coefficient shifts from +0.0710 (base) to +0.0742 (full) — a shift of +0.0032. Scaled by the base-spec SE of 0.0081, this is +0.39 SEs. The features do not materially displace the censoring signal; the bias estimate is robust.

### (3) Verdict Paragraph

**Does anything in the raw data explain the excess edge beyond biasTotals?**

The tested features — week, neutralSite, conferenceGame, and home_dog — show very limited ability to explain the excess overs beyond the censoring baseline. Only one feature (neutralSite) clears the Bonferroni threshold, and its effect is small (−0.022 standardized). The biasTotals coefficient remains stable when features are added (+0.39 SE shift, well under 1 SE), confirming that the raw-data features do not overlap with the censoring-bias signal in a materially meaningful way.

**No feature materially displaces the censoring signal.** One feature (neutralSite) clears the Bonferroni bar with a small negative effect that does not undermine the biasTotals estimate. The finding is consistent with the open question: if the over-edge exists beyond measurement error in implied points, censoring in team scoring, and week/location/matchup effects, then either (a) a feature not yet considered (e.g., recruit rankings, coaching tenure, game importance) drives it, or (b) the excess is statistical noise that vanishes under proper multiple-comparison control.

With ~12k games a standardized probit coefficient below ≈0.03 is undetectable at this power; absence of significance is not absence of effect for smaller influences.

**Note:** The feature list was originally `["week", "neutralSite", "conferenceGame", "fcs_dog"]` per B4.1, but `fcs_dog` had zero variance post-join (no FCS teams carry betting lines in the dataset). Per BLOCKERS.md commit 11b2500, `fcs_dog` was substituted with `home_dog` (an underutilized candidate from B4.1's ranked list) to preserve the 4-feature budget and Bonferroni denominator. The analysis reported here tests the substituted feature set.
