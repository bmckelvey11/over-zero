"""B7 - test betting the UNDER on totals lines in the 55-65 band.

B6 tested ">66 -> under" and filed a null. The 55-65 band is a different
question that B6's bin edges straddle: 55-59 falls inside a region averaging
50.18% under, 59-66 inside one averaging 52.49%. This tests the band directly,
with materially more power than B6 had (N ~4-5k vs 977).

Pre-registered before running (see RESULTS.md for the same list):

  [A] Disjoint sub-bins 55-59 / 59-62 / 62-65 BEFORE the 55-65 aggregate, so a
      real plateau is distinguishable from an average across two regimes.
  [B] Band-restricted probit on the totals level. If the band is just a slice
      of a continuous gradient, the slope inside it should look like B6's.
  [C] Feature scan INSIDE the band. Candidate pool fixed up front from
      b4_features/INVENTORY.md (week, neutral_site, conference_game, home_dog)
      plus the two line-shape variables the model already knows (spread,
      censoring bias). Every feature tested is reported, not just survivors.
  [D] Any cell clearing break-even goes through the repo's walk-forward
      protocol (train on seasons <= t-1, bet season t) - the discriminator
      between "found a cell" and "found an edge".

Break-even is 52.36%, measured from real consensus under prices in
data/raw/actionnetwork_odds.csv (4,399 games, 2018/2019/2023-2025): books do
NOT shade the under on high totals, median under price is -110 in every band.
So the -110 hurdle is the right one, not an assumption.
